# BookMaker

### ACM-MISIS Team Reference Document

BookMaker searches directory for *.h and *.cpp files. It combines *.h files into HEADER and compiles every *.cpp file with this HEADER. 

### Usage

- cd java
- javac BookMaker.java
- java BookMaker ../cpp (on OS X add -../cpp/gnu_c_treap.cpp -../cpp/priority_queue_container.cpp)

### TODO

* Check files endings
* Remove HEADER from *.cpp file
* Always clear folder
* Kill g++.exe after 5 seconds. 
* Make *.pdf document
* Split BookMaker class
